# Gruntwork
Gruntwork is a mission making framework for Arma 3 designed with performance and usability in mind. It's primarily based on components of the F3 Framework, such as assignGears and Group Markers. Gruntwork has also been designed around the use of the ACRE2 and ACE3 addons.

Also included is a custom factions folder, which uses classnames from addons within the PhanTactical Mod Pack.
